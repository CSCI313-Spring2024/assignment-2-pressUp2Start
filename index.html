        <h4>Why I chose my major</h4>
        <d1>
          When I was in middle school I was able to choose between several
          electives each year. For the first two years one of the electives I
          chose was STEM. Out of all the STEM units, my favorite was programming
          and I was disapointed when the second year didn't have much of a
          programing unit. In high school I took more programming courses and
          enjoyed them, so I thought that I may be able to make a career out of
          programming. While my initial plan was to go into game design, I am
          not so sure if that is the career I wish to pursue. I have been hoping
          to get an internship in order to explore new career options.
